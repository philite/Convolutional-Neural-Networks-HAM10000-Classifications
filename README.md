Python notebooks for CNN classifiers in Tensorflow for melanoma and non-melanoma classification.

This is part of project in Research Methodology course for CS major.

## Objective

1. Compare performance between CNN architectures for melanoma and non-melanoma classifications with HAM10000 dataset
2. Compare performance when handling unbalance dataset with MobileNetV2

### Performance between CNN architectures

Compare the performance from 3 architectures

- ResNet50
- VGGNet16
- MobileNetV2

### Handling unbalance dataset from HAM10000 and train with MobileNetV2

- Original (raw) unbalance dataset training as control group
- Undersampling
- Oversampling
